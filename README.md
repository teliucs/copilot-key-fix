# Copilot Key Fix

A tiny Linux helper that reclaims your Copilot key — and turns it into something useful.

Copilotctl remaps the **Copilot key** (found on newer laptops) to launch a small AI assistant
using **Zenity** and a Hugging Face model like **Meta Llama 3**.

(Tested only on Fedora)

## 🚀 Features

- Blocks or remaps the Copilot key
- Launches a lightweight AI popup (powered by Hugging Face)
- Uses `zenity` for GUI dialogs and `jq` for JSON parsing
- Works entirely locally except for API calls
